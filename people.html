      Darren received his B.S. in Music Busines (yes, Music Business!!) from Loyola University New Orleans in 2002. After a brief stint in the music industry in Los Angeles, he realized that his true passion was genomics (it's a long story). So, Darren spent a few years in the Vercelli Lab here at UofA, where he was first exposed to asthma genomics research. Darren went on to receive his Ph.D. in Human Genetics from The University of Chicago (in Yoav Gilad's lab). While there, Darren studied how genetic variation in human populations perturbs gene expression and can lead to complex disease susceptibilities. Darren then pursued postdoctoral studies in Jay Shendure's lab at the University of Washington. In Seattle, he developed a novel single-cell chromatin accessibility assay and applied it to several model systems to study the variation in gene regulatory landscapes present in complex tissues.

      In 2018, Darren accepted a position here at the University of Arizona in Cellular and Molecular Medicine and the Asthma & Airway Disease Research Center.
